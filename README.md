# MY FIRST MULTI LAYER PERCEPTRON (MLP)
Back to my collage days, I took a lecture on complex systems, where I implemented my first perceptron neural network.
Here I show it. It recognize the alphabet by pattern. Once you load one pattern (letter) you can modify it and see if the perceptron can recognize it.
It works natively in windows XP, was programed in Delphi 7.
